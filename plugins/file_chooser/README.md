# About

The authors describe their plugin as the following:

```quote

This plugin provides access to a native file chooser for Open and Save operations.

This is a prototype, and in the long term will either be replaced by functionality
within the Flutter framework itself, or a published plugin (likely part of
flutter/plugins). Either way, the API may change significantly.
```
